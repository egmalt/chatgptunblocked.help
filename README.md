## Custom domain (chatgptunblocked.help)

To open this page at **https://chatgptunblocked.help**:

1. In your domain registrar (where you bought chatgptunblocked.help), open DNS settings.
2. Add one of the following:

   **Option A – CNAME (recommended for apex/subdomain):**  
   - Type: `CNAME`  
   - Name: `@` (or `www` if you use www)  
   - Value: `egmalt.github.io`

   **Option B – A records (for apex domain):**  
   - Add 4 A records pointing to:
     - `185.199.108.153`
     - `185.199.109.153`
     - `185.199.110.153`
     - `185.199.111.153`

3. Wait 5–30 minutes for DNS to update. GitHub will then enable HTTPS for the custom domain.
